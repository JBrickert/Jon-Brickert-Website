							Article 1: Introduction to HTML
						</h2>
						<p class="card-text">Date: November 13, 2023</p>
						<p class="card-text">Author: John Doe</p>
						<h3>What is HTML?</h3>
						<p>
							HTML, short for <em>HyperText Markup Language</em>,
							is the foundational language that structures content
							on the World Wide Web. It's the glue that binds
							text, images, links, and multimedia, transforming
							them into the interactive and dynamic web
							experiences we encounter every day.
						</p>

						<p>
							HTML doesn't require a computer science degree to
							understand. Instead, it operates on a system of
							tags, which are like building blocks that define the
							elements on a webpage. These tags tell web browsers
							how to display and organize content, creating the
							seamless and visually appealing web pages we've come
							to expect.
						</p>

						<h3>What You Will Learn</h3>
						<p>
							In this introductory journey into HTML, we'll cover
							the basics to equip you with the essential skills to
							start crafting your own webpages. Here's a sneak
							peek of what's in store:
						</p>

						<h4>Understanding HTML Tags:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Explore the diverse world of HTML tags and learn
								how to use them to structure content.
							</li>
							<li>
								Dive into heading tags (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>
								to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>) for titles,
								paragraph tags (<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>) for
								text, and anchor tags (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>)
								for links.
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Creating Links and Navigation:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Master the art of hyperlinking to connect
								different webpages effortlessly.
							</li>

								(<code>&lt;head&gt;</code>) and body
								(<code>&lt;body&gt;</code>) sections.
							</li>
							<li>
								Comprehend the purpose of the DOCTYPE
								declaration (<code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>)
								and how it sets the tone for your webpage.
							</li>
						</ul>

							Article 8: Getting Started with Git and GitHub
						</h2>
						<p class="card-text">Date: November 20, 2023</p>
						<p class="card-text">Author: Jessica Green</p>
						<p>
							Welcome to the world of version control with Git and
							collaboration on GitHub! In this article, we'll
							guide you through the basics of using Git for
							version control and introduce you to GitHub, a
							platform that makes collaborative development a
							breeze.
						</p>

						<h3>What is Git?</h3>
						<p>
							Git is a distributed version control system that
							helps you track changes in your codebase over time.
							It allows you to collaborate with others seamlessly,
							revert to previous stages of your project, and
							manage different versions of your code efficiently.
						</p>

						<h3>Installing Git</h3>
						<p>
							To get started, you'll need to install Git on your
							machine. You can download the installer for your
							operating system from the official Git website:
							<a
								href="https://git-scm.com/downloads"
								target="_blank"
								>https://git-scm.com/downloads</a
							>.
						</p>

						<h3>Basic Git Commands</h3>
						<p>
							Once Git is installed, you can use it through the
							command line. Here are some essential Git commands
							to get you started:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<code>git init</code>: Initializes a new Git
								repository in your project.
							</li>
							<li>
								<code>git add [filename]</code>: Adds a file to
								the staging area for the next commit.
							</li>
							<li>
								<code>git commit -m "Your commit message"</code
								>: Commits the changes in the staging area with
								a descriptive message.
							</li>
							<li>
								<code>git status</code>: Shows the status of
								your changes (untracked, modified, or staged).
							</li>
							<li>
								<code>git log</code>: Displays a log of your
								commit history.
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>What is GitHub?</h3>
						<p>
							GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting
							for software development projects using Git. It adds
							a collaborative layer on top of Git, allowing
							multiple developers to work on a project
							simultaneously, manage issues, and track changes
							easily.
						</p>

						<h3>Creating a GitHub Account</h3>
						<p>
							If you don't have a GitHub account, go to
							<a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank"
								>https://github.com/</a
							>
							and sign up for a free account. Once registered, you
							can create and manage your repositories, contribute
							to other projects, and collaborate with developers
							worldwide.
						</p>

						<h3>Pushing Code to GitHub</h3>
						<p>
							To push your local Git repository to GitHub, follow
							these steps:
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Create a new repository on GitHub.</li>
							<li>Copy the repository URL.</li>
							<li>
								In your local Git repository, run
								<code
									>git remote add origin [repository
									URL]</code
								>.
							</li>
							<li>
								Run <code>git push -u origin master</code> to
								push your code to GitHub.
							</li>
						</ol>

						<h3>Conclusion</h3>
						<p>
							Congratulations! You've taken your first steps into
							the world of version control with Git and GitHub. As
							you continue your journey, explore more advanced Git
							features, learn about branching and merging, and
							embrace the collaborative nature of GitHub. Happy
							coding!
